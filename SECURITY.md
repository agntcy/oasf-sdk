## Report a security issue

The OASF-SDK project team welcomes security reports and is committed to
providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be
reported privately via [security@agntcy.org](mailto:security@agntcy.org).
Security issues should not be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.


## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The
project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect
users of OASF-SDK, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

Downstream project maintainers and OASF-SDK users can request participation in
coordination of applicable security issues by sending your contact email address,
GitHub username(s) and any other salient information to [security@agntcy.org](mailto:security@agntcy.org).
Participation in security issue coordination processes is at the discretion of the OASF-SDK team.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure
process. The OASF-SDK team announces security issues via [project GitHub Release notes](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf-sdk/releases).
